v0.8.3

Minor fixes to pass CRAN.


v0.8.1

Mostly minor manual edits

CRAN requires that all warnings & notes be resolved.

To get CRAN Approval - had to fix 3 minor things:
* Description file

  Need to use one of licenses in http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/
  Switched to: GPL_2 for now

* Namespace file
  is.efficient() has no man page

  Temp fix - removed is.efficient from namespace file and stopped exporting.

  Long term fix - figure out public / private functions and determine if this
  needs to be exported.

  Need to use TFDEA:::is.efficient() for now.

* Had to add import in NAMESPACE for lpSolveAPI since it's dependency.
