%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{x}{Inputs or resources used by each decision making unit}

\item{y}{Outputs or products of each decision making unit}

\item{dmu_date_rel}{Date of introduction (release) for decision making unit or product}

\item{date_forecast}{Date of forecast}

\item{rts}{Returns to scale for the application, production technology, or industry studied

\tabular{rl}{
  vrs \tab Variable returns to scale, convexity and free disposability \cr
  drs \tab Decreasing returns to scale, convexity, down-scaling and free disposability \cr
  crs \tab Constant returns to scale, convexity and free disposability \cr
  irs \tab Increasing returns to scale, (up-scaling, but not down-scaling), convexity and
  free disposability \cr
  }
}

\item{orientation}{Orientation of the DEA model - primary emphasis on input-reduction \code{input}
or output-augmentation \code{output}. Note that unlike the DEA functions, the default
is \code{output} orientation.}

\item{second}{Optional: Enables an alternate secondary objective function based on the product
of lambda and dmu_date_rel.  The default is \code{min}.  Other options include \code{none} or
\code{max} which will then skip this step or minimize date * lambda while holding the efficiency
constant.}

\item{mode}{Declares if the technology forecast is done using \code{static} or \code{dynamic}
frontiers.  A static frontier is where the forecast is made using a fixed date of date_forecast.
A dynamic frontier allows for different based dates on the frontier based on the product of
dmu_date and lambda.  When a dynamic frontier is selected, a secondary objective function should
be specified to avoid problems with multiple optima (\code{second=min} or \code{max})}

\item{segroc}{Uses segmented rate of change if \code{TURE}.}

\item{debug}{Optional: Only for debugging. If \code{debug} is a integer greater then zero
debug information will be output.}

\value{

TFDEA returns sets of values at three points in time, at the initial release of the product,
\code{_rel}, at the forecast data specified by \code{date_forecast}, \code{_cur}, and for
the date in the future when the product is forecast \code{for}.

The function returns a number of values per product (DMU). The standardized efficiency (all
inefficiencies are between 0 and 1, for \code{input} and \code{output} orientation) \code{eff},
and the lambda values, \code{lambda}, are returned.

A rate of technology change \code{roc} is returned for products efficient at release. At current
time a local rate of change and at forecast time an individualized rate of change is
returned - \code{sroc}. If \code{segroc = FALSE} then the \code{sroc} is the average
rate of change and is the same for every product.

Lastly a date for current and forecast is returned, \code{date}. If \code{mode = dynamic} then the
current date is the current date adjusted by what products the product is being compared to. If
\code{static} is used then the \code{date} is the \code{date_forecast} for all products. If the
product release date is in the future then a forecast for the product is returned.

Not all values are calculated for all products at all points in time. For example a a product
released in the past with that is inefficient at release would not have a \code{roc} or \code{sroc}
calculated because the product is not used to calculate the overall rate of technology change.

\item{$dmu_date_cur}{Adjusted current date for DMU}
\item{$dmu_roc_cur}{Rate of Change for product from date of release to current date}
\item{$dmu_sroc_cur}{Local rate of change for the product}
